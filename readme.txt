<h4>How to Create a Coupon</h4>
Create a coupon by going to the coupon custom post type and filling in all the settings in the custom meta box.

Insert the coupon into a post or page using the shortcode inserter above the content editor.

Coupon displays until the expiration date that is chosen by you or you can check the Ignore Expiration Checkbox and the coupon will display on the site past the expiration date or with no date at all.

<h4>Coupon Creator Shortcode</h4>

The Coupon Shortcode:
	[coupon couponid="xx" category="Category Name(optional)" coupon_align="cctor_aligncenter" name="Coupon Name"]

Manually replace fields in shortcode:

couponid - replace xx with ID of Coupon custom post

couponalign - align coupon options:  cctor_aligncenter,  cctor_alignnone,  cctor_alignleft, and  cctor_alignright

name -optional and for your reference only

<h4>Coupon Loop</h4>

Set couponid to "loop" to display all coupons. (couponid="loop")

All the coupons in the loop will use the same couponalign.

<h4>Coupon Categories</h4>

Assign categories to a coupon using the loop option only to display coupons from a specific category.

category - add the category name to display coupons only from it

For example, if you have a category called "Coupon Home Page", call it by:

category="Coupon Home Page"

<h4>Coupon Shortcode Inserter</h4>

Above the post editor, click the "Add Coupon" button to open the inserter.

Select an individual coupon or coupon loop.

If you select the coupon loop, an option will appear to select a coupon category for the loop or you can leave it blank for all coupons (default).

The third option to select is the couponalign.

Once you have all the options selected, press "Insert Coupon" to insert the shortcode into the editor.

<h4>Examples</h4>

Find examples of coupons on the [Coupon Creator Home Page](http://cctor.link/JIGHR)

<h4>Coupons in Text Widgets</h4>

Coupons will work in Sidebar Text Widgets, but you must add

add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');

To your theme's function.php

<h4>Coupon Options</h4>

On the options page set default colors for new coupons.

Another option for nofollow on the links and templates along with an option to hide the click to print link.

You can add custom css in the options and it will modify both the shortcode coupon and the print template.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
<h4>What if I have support questions?</h4>
Please ask on the [Coupon Creator Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/coupon-creator) on WordPress. For Pro users, please visit [Coupon Creator Pro](http://cctor.link/JIGHR). On CouponCreatorPlugin.com there are documentation on the css and hooks of the coupon creator as well as more answers to questions and premium tutorials as well.

<h4>The Coupon Inserter, Image Uploader, the Expiration Date Picker, or the Color Pickers are not working, what is wrong?</h4>
Most likely this is a JavaScript error and could be caused by another plugin or your theme. Please check the Developer Console for your browser and see if there is an error. If you post the error on the support forum I maybe able to help. Otherwise, try disabling plugins and changing themes to try and find the sources as well.

<h4>How do I fix 404 Errors on the Print View of the Coupons? </h4>
The cause of the conflict can be hosting, plugin, or theme related.
First, try to resave your permalinks and then check the Print View.
If that does not work, try disabling plugins and/or changing the themes and check again.
If none of that works, it could be a conflict with the hosting setup.

<h4>My coupon was working and now it does not display, how can I fix it? </h4>
Please check if the expiration date has passed and whether or not the ignore expiration is checked. If it is checked or the date is still in the future, please post on the Support Forum in WordPress about the issue and include a link to the page so I can check for errors.

<h4>Where does the shortcode go? </h4>
Insert the shortcode in the content editor of a post, page, or custom post type.

<h4>How can I display coupons using the shortcode in a sidebar text widget? </h4>
Add this coding to your theme's function.php:

add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');

<h4>How can I prevent coupons from appearing in a site search? </h4>
By default the coupons are excluded from search. However, if you add coding to show custom post types in the search, you would have to exclude the custom post type, cctor_coupon.

<h4>How big of an image is the coupon?</h4>
There are two sizes, but the image uploaded should be 400 pixels by 200 pixels to display correctly.

Does the Coupon Creator have custom capabilities for WordPress users?
Yes, with version 1.90 custom capabilities have been added. See Documentation at CouponCreatorPlugin.com for more information.

<h4>Can I change cctor_coupon in the print view permalink? </h4>
With version 1.70 you can change the slug of the permalink in the Options section of the plugin. Coupon > Options > Permalink Tab

<h4>Can I have both an image and text in the coupon? </h4>
You can add html coding to the discount box, but there is no visual editor to do it.

<h4>How do I customize the coupon (make bigger, change layout, etc...)?</h4>
There is no direct way to customize the look of the coupon in the WordPress dashboard beyond the change of colors without doing custom coding. In Coupon Creator Pro, there are more options to modify the look of the coupons including background images, the visual editor for terms, set default sizes for coupons and image coupons as well, and many more options.

How can I remove the Click to Open in Print View or Click to Print Text?
With version 1.90 on this tab Coupons > Options > Link Attributes/Permalinks Tab you can choose to hide the Click to Open in Print View Link for all Coupons.
